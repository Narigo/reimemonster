# Reimemonster

This repository contains helpers for making poems. For example it counts syllables and helps you find rhyming words.

Currently only usable in German.

## Warning

It uses the npm module `hyphen` to split words into syllables. This is not completely correct for all words, as some 
words should not be splitted but still have multiple syllables. The German word "oder" is an example for that.
